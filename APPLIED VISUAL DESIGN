*Creating visual design using text-align property*
Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.
//to make font bold
font-weight: bold;

// to make the underline
text-decoration: underline;

// to make the text italic OR italicize
font-style: italic;

// to make the font a strikethrough
text-decoration: line-through;

box shadow property:
The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes values for

offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
blur-radius,
spread-radius and
color, in that order.
The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.
box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);

The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.

// line height
CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, 
it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.

This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

a:hover {
  color: red;
}
The code editor has a CSS rule to style all a tags black. Add a rule so that when the user hovers over the a tag, the color is blue.
