style can be of three types and its a best practice to end the inline style with a ; (semi colon).

creating class for decorating the elements..

Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class
Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements. You can see this by applying your red-text class to the first p elemen

Change the Font Size of an Element
Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:
h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

Import a Google FontPassed
To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge,
we'll import the Lobster font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening style element):
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;    The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available.
Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font,
but not to use the Lobster font.

Size Your Images
CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.

border-radius (giving the perent value will shape it round)
border
style
color
width
font-family
font-size
backgrounf-color 

we can also create the multiple classes for the same html element class="class1 lass2"

One cool thing about id attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.

However, an id is not reusable and should only be applied to one element. An id also has a higher specificity (importance) than a class so if both are applied to the same
element and have conflicting styles, the styles of the id will be applied.

Here's an example of how you can take your element with the id attribute of cat-photo-element and give it the background color of green. In your style element:
#cat-photo-element {
  background-color: green;
}
Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.
 
Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, border, and margin.
An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border.
Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has more padding than the blue box.
When you increase the blue box's padding, it will increase the distance (padding) between the text and the border around it
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.
