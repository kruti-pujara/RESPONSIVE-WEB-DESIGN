style can be of three types and its a best practice to end the inline style with a ; (semi colon).

Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class
Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements. You can see this by applying your red-text class to the first p elemen

Change the Font Size of an Element
Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:
h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

Import a Google FontPassed
To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge,
we'll import the Lobster font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening style element):
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;    The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available.
Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font,
but not to use the Lobster font.

Size Your Images
CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.
