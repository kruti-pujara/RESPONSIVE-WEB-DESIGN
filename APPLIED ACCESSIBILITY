Note: The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. An article is for standalone content,
and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section.
When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.
<div> - groups content <section> - groups related content <article> - groups independent, self-contained content..
